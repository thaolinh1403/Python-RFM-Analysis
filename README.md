# RFM Analysis
## Introduction
### Business question
- SuperStore is a global retail company, so it has a large customer base. On the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, the Marketing department wants to run marketing campaigns to show appreciation to customers who have supported the company over time. The Marketing Director has proposed using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was smaller, the team could manually calculate and classify using Excel. Currently, the volume of data is too large, so they wish the Data department to build a deployment pipeline for assessing Segmentation through Python programming.
- Analyze the current situation of the company and provide suggestions for the Marketing team.
- Provide recommendations to the Marketing and Sales teams on which of the 3 R,F,M metrics they should focus on in Superstore's retail model.
